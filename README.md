# Exam project

Big Data course (81932), University of Bologna.

As of A.Y. 2021/22, the project must be carried out on your AWS Virtual Lab.

- Load the dataset(s) on S3
- Produce a Report in the form of a Notebook that integrates the Spark jobs
- To deliver the project, make sure that you have >10$ left in your credits, then notify the teacher via email and send:
  - The notebook (with all the cells executed)
  - The .ppk (or .pem) file used to connect to the cluster via SSH
  - Any additional material (e.g., Power BI or Tableau file, or pictures used in the notebook)

## Datasets

Go on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv&sizeStart=5%2CGB) and look for CSV datasets with minimum 5GB of data. Many of them contain multimedia files (e.g., audio tracks, images), so you need to search through the pages for valid textual datasets. Some examples:

- [US Stock Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/footballjoe789/us-stock-dataset?select=Data)
- [Ethereum Blockchain](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buryhuang/ethereum-blockchain)
- [COVID-19 Complete Twitter Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imoore/covid19-complete-twitter-dataset-daily-updates)
- [Official Reddit r/place Dataset CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoinecarpentier/redditrplacecsv)
